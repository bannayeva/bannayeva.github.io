    <h1>Aliya Bannayeva</h1>
    
    <p>Final semester master student at TU Munich. I did my thesis at the <a href="https://db.in.tum.de/">Chair for Database Systems</a> under the supervision of Altan Birler and Prof. Thomas Neumann, on multi-join cardinality estimation using sketches. My current focus is on adaptive query optimization.</p>
    
    <p>Outside of databases, my interests are mainly surrounding mathematics (concentration bounds) and materials science (crystallography). I'm always open to collaborating on interesting projects, please feel free to reach out for a chat.</p>
